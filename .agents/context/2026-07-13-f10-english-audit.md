# 2026-07-13 — F-10 English-language audit — RUN LOG (BLOCKED on kubectl/Omni auth outage)

**Status: NOT EXECUTED.** The owner-ordered library-wide English audit (Audiobooks / EBooks /
Comics) could not run this session. Every path to the live media estate is closed by the
kubectl/Omni auth outage combined with no locally-available app credentials. This note is the
run log: what was tried, the reachability facts it established (useful to the next run), the
method (unchanged, staged for the post-re-auth run), F-09 leftover status from records, the
last-known LL/governor state, and the owner prerequisites to unblock.

**Zero changes were made to the media estate** — no quarantine moves, no LL queue entries, no
MAM/qBittorrent/Prowlarr touches, no rescans. Every hard constraint is satisfied vacuously.

---

## 1. The blockage (evidence)

### 1a. kubectl / Omni auth is dead — interactive-only, not repairable here
- `~/.kube/config` has two contexts, **both** `oidc-login get-token` (interactive browser):
  - `haynes-ops` → issuer `https://haynes.na-west-1.omni.siderolabs.io/oidc`
  - `haynes-edge` → issuer `https://omni.haynesops.com/oidc`
  - No static-token / client-cert user exists on either.
- Cached token `~/.kube/cache/oidc-login/f5b8…eccf` is **expired** (`exp 1783956966`, ~8.5 h stale
  at run time `1783987582`). `kubectl version` / `get ns` / `get pods` all **hang** (the exec
  plugin falls through to `authcode-browser`, waiting on `0.0.0.0:8000` for a browser that will
  never come) — the exact `authcode-browser … context deadline exceeded` outage the brief names.
- Per the brief: **do not attempt auth repair.** Confirmed dead, moved on.
- Consequence: **no `kubectl exec`** (⇒ no reading epub OPF `dc:language`, no inspecting on-disk
  filenames / narrator markers, no moving files to quarantine, no triggering scans on the pods)
  and **no `kubectl port-forward`** (⇒ internal-only services unreachable).

### 1b. No cluster network from the WSL host
- `getent hosts kavita.media.svc.cluster.local` (and other `*.svc.cluster.local`) do not resolve.
  There is no in-cluster path even for services that have no public ingress.

### 1c. No app credentials available locally
- `.env.local` carries only `DATABASE_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL` — nothing for
  the book apps.
- `packages/books/src/config.ts` + `.env.example`: the app authenticates to Kavita as **`hnetadmin`**
  and ABS as **`root`**, with `KAVITA_PASSWORD` / `AUDIOBOOKSHELF_PASSWORD` sourced from the
  **1Password `kavita` / `audiobookshelf` items → cluster ExternalSecret**. Those passwords are
  not present in any local env, and there is **no `op` (1Password) CLI** installed/authed on this
  host. No cached Kavita/ABS/LL API keys, tokens, or passwords anywhere in `~` or shell history.

### 1d. Reachability probe results (the useful part for next run)
| Endpoint | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `https://kavita.haynesnetwork.com/api/health` | **200** | only open endpoint; all data needs API key/JWT |
| `https://kavita.haynesnetwork.com/` | 200 | OIDC-gated UI |
| **`https://audiobookshelf.haynesnetwork.com/status`** | **200** | **correct ABS host**; `serverVersion 2.35.1`, `authMethods [local, openid]`, `authOpenIDAutoLaunch:true` |
| `https://audiobookshelf.haynesnetwork.com/api/libraries` | **401** | needs bearer token |
| `https://abs.haynesnetwork.com/…` | **000** | **wrong host** — does not resolve/serve; the brief/polish-loop's loose "abs.haynesnetwork.com" should read **`audiobookshelf.`** |
| `lazylibrarian` / `prowlarr` / `qbittorrent` / `kapowarr` `.haynesnetwork.com` | **000** | **no public ingress** — internal-only, need cluster access |
| `https://haynesnetwork.com/` | 307 | OIDC redirect |

**Net:** the two reachable book apps (Kavita, ABS) are 401 without credentials I don't have;
LazyLibrarian (the only sanctioned re-grab surface) has no public route at all. Detection AND
remediation are both blocked.

---

## 2. Method (unchanged — staged for the post-re-auth run)

Nothing about the proven method changed; it simply needs cluster/app access to run.
- **EBooks:** read `dc:language` from each epub's zip OPF (the Matilda/Maas sweep-script pattern);
  flag azw3-only titles (invisible to Kavita); check **series folders file-by-file** (Kavita merges
  all files in a series folder into one series — one foreign file poisons the series; a series-level
  language tag is not sufficient — the Matilda lesson).
- **Audiobooks (ABS):** `metadata.json` + ID3/publisher heuristics (**HörbucHHamburg = German tell**)
  + track-name language.
- **Comics (Kavita):** filename / ComicInfo metadata pass.
- **Remediate (field-proven loop):** quarantine the foreign copy under `books/quarantine/<concern>/`
  (**move + rescan, never delete**; one subfolder per concern, mirroring `german-audio/` and
  `f09-corrupt/` / `f09-originals/`) → LL English re-grab (**keyed GB volume-id → `addBook` →
  `queueBook`/`searchBook`, with mandatory 503 retry/backoff** — GB `backendFailed` bursts hit keyed
  calls too) → Kavita and/or ABS rescan. **LL is the only re-grab surface**; usenet-first works now,
  MAM re-engages itself when the governor reopens the gate.
- **Ambiguity rule:** quarantine only clear-cut foreign items (definitive language evidence);
  bilingual/unclear → owner question, untouched.

---

## 3. Audit results — all blocked

| Kind | Scanned | Foreign found | Quarantined | Re-grabs queued | Ambiguous-left-alone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Audiobooks (ABS) | 0 (BLOCKED) | — | — | — | — |
| EBooks (Kavita) | 0 (BLOCKED) | — | — | — | — |
| Comics (Kavita) | 0 (BLOCKED) | — | — | — | — |

- **azw3-only strays:** not enumerable without file/API access — deferred to next run.
- **Empty folders:** not enumerable — deferred.
- **Old-format duplicates beside fresh imports:** not enumerable — deferred.
- No fabricated findings: every figure above is honestly zero/blocked.

---

## 4. F-09 leftover status (from records — NOT re-verified live this run)

Sourced from `2026-07-11-polish-loop.md` (F-09) and `2026-07-13-session-5-wrap.md`; could not be
re-checked against the estate this session.
- **3 zip-corrupt quarantined epubs** in `books/quarantine/f09-corrupt/`: **Skyward**,
  **Sweet and Deadly** (0-byte), **Skin in the Game** → English re-grabs **still to be queued**
  (the session-5 wrap's LL retry queue lists only the ToG/Maas items, not these three).
  **Could not queue** this run (LL unreachable). Re-grab candidates for the next run.
- **7 other-defect epubs, untouched** (a distinct defect class): 5× "Unsupported EPUB version 1.0"
  package attributes + 2× EPUB3 nav-structure. Documented as their own future polish item.
- **Backups** of all F-09-touched originals: `books/quarantine/f09-originals/`.
- `Foundation.epub` thumbnail nit (valid JPEG; Kavita hands the OPF-guide XHTML to libvips) — left
  untouched, reads fine; fix = set/lock cover in Kavita UI.

---

## 5. LL / governor — last-known state (from records, NOT observed this run)

I could not reach LazyLibrarian or the governor (internal-only; kubectl dead), so nothing below was
observed — it is the carried-forward state, recorded so the next run knows the baseline:
- **MAM gate CLOSED** post-Maas-batch (~19 torrents in `books-mam`, unsatisfied > 15, maturing
  ~Tue eve; the governor reopens it itself). Usenet flows regardless.
- **LL retry queue** (on LL's 6h cycle): Throne of Glass bk1 (epub + audio), Heir of Fire audio,
  Kingdom of Ash epub. **Do not disturb** (unchanged — nothing was touched).
- The `No ebook-convert found` calibre gap in LL's image persists (list conversion candidates as
  findings; never attempt conversion) — no candidates gathered this run.

---

## 6. Owner questions / prerequisites to unblock (next run)

- **Q-01 (the unblocker):** Owner re-auth of Omni/kubectl is required — an interactive
  `oidc-login` browser flow (the owner did this earlier in session 5 via `! kubectl …`). That single
  action restores `kubectl exec` (file access for OPF/quarantine) **and** in-cluster reach to
  LazyLibrarian, and lets the F-10 method run start-to-finish. **Re-dispatch F-10 after re-auth.**
- **Q-02 (hardening, owner's call):** consider a non-interactive read path for audit agents so a
  future Omni outage doesn't fully block a read-plus-LL-queue audit — e.g. surface the Kavita/ABS
  API keys (or an `op` service-account token scoped to `kavita`/`audiobookshelf`) into a gitignored
  local env. Optional.
- **Q-03 (doc hygiene):** the ABS public host is **`audiobookshelf.haynesnetwork.com`**, not
  `abs.haynesnetwork.com` (the latter 000s). Worth correcting in the polish-loop/F-10 shorthand so
  the next agent doesn't chase the dead host.

---

## 7. What was NOT done (constraints honored trivially)

No MAM grabs, no qBittorrent adds, no Prowlarr MAM-indexer toggle, no LL retry-queue disturbance,
no quarantine moves, no rescans, no deletions — the estate was never reached, let alone modified.
No auth repair attempted. No app code / haynes-ops / other plans / HANDOFF touched. No release.

---

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# RUN 2 — EXECUTED (2026-07-13 night, post-re-auth). Full audit + remediation ran.
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Status: COMPLETE.** kubectl/Omni re-authed; `haynes-ops` all 6 nodes Ready. The full library-wide
English audit ran start-to-finish against the live estate. **58 clear-cut foreign items quarantined**
(33 EBooks + 25 AudioBooks), **Comics 100 % English (0 foreign)**, both Kavita+ABS rescanned, **3 F-09
corrupt epubs re-grab-queued (English, Wanted)**. Existing LL retry queue untouched; MAM gate observed
CLOSED (correct). Ambiguity rule honored — leaned-English / genre-tag-only items left for the owner.

## R2.1 — Reachability + tooling (corrections/additions to §1)
- Storage layout: all book apps mount cephfs at `/data/cephfs-hdd`; the estate lives at
  **`/data/cephfs-hdd/data/media/books/{EBooks,AudioBooks,Comics,quarantine}`**. Kavita pod =
  ns `media` `kavita-*` container **`app`**; ABS = ns `media` `audiobookshelf-*`; LL = ns `downloads`
  `lazylibrarian-*` container **`app`** — all three mount the same books volume.
- **Kavita pod is minimal** (no python3 / unzip / busybox). **LazyLibrarian's pod HAS python3 3.12**
  and mounts the same cephfs → **used the LL pod as the read/analysis + move engine** (`kubectl exec`,
  zipfile/urllib/sqlite3 stdlib, no extra deps). Quarantine `mv` is `os.rename` within one cephfs
  volume = atomic/instant regardless of size (the 570-track audiobooks moved as fast as a 1-file epub).
- **Kavita/ABS rescans driven in-cluster**: creds are in `frontend/haynesnetwork-secret`
  (`KAVITA_PASSWORD`, `AUDIOBOOKSHELF_PASSWORD`); users `hnetadmin` / `root`; in-cluster URLs
  `http://kavita.media.svc.cluster.local:5000` + `http://audiobookshelf.media.svc.cluster.local:13378`.
  Kavita `POST /api/Account/login`→JWT→`POST /api/Library/scan?libraryId=1&force=true`. ABS
  `POST /login`→token→`POST /api/libraries/{id}/scan`. Both returned **HTTP 200**.
- **LL API**: `http://localhost:5299/api?apikey=<config.ini api_key>&cmd=…`; the keyed GB works
  (`gb_api` in config.ini). qBittorrent WebAPI answers unauthenticated from the pod net
  (`http://qbittorrent.downloads.svc.cluster.local:8080`).

## R2.2 — Method that actually worked (tag alone is NOT enough — the key lesson)
- **EBooks:** scanned **all 1374 epubs** two ways: (a) OPF `dc:language`, (b) a **content
  stopword-ratio detector** (en/nl/de/fr/es/da/it/pt) over ~1.2–1.5k words of spine text. **Metadata
  tags are unreliable** — ~40 epubs carry spurious `UND` / `da` / `es` / `inh` tags on plainly-English
  books (all of John Grisham, Cormac McCarthy, Roald Dahl, Tolkien's HoME, Rick Riordan, Terry
  Pratchett, Charlaine Harris, etc. detected `en` by content). Only where **content + (title|OPF|tag)
  agree** was an item called foreign. Full-tree content scan surfaced **no** foreign book hiding under
  an `en` tag (candidate set from the tag scan was complete).
- **AudioBooks:** metadata.json (`language`/`publisher`/`description`) MISSES most cases (scraped
  English metadata over German audio). The decisive signal is **audio-native ID3** across the first
  ~3 tracks/folder: `TALB`/`TIT2` (German book titles, `Kapitel`, `Teil`, `Ungekürzt`), `TPE2` German
  narrators (Reinhard Kuhnert, Birgitta Assheuer, Simon Jäger), `TPUB` German labels (Der Hörverlag,
  Random House Audio Deutschland, Lübbe Audio, Sauerländer). Metadata.json alone found 17; **the ID3
  pass found 23 true German audiobooks** (Lord of Shadows, City of Ashes, City of Heavenly Fire, DUNE
  IV, German Dune III, Grey, Dead or Alive, Children of Blood and Bone, De/Das Silmarillion, Rich Dad
  Poor Dad, The Other Emily — several with **English folder names but German audio**).
- **Comics:** ComicInfo.xml `LanguageISO` across 946 cbz (148 `en`, 72 no-lang, 726 no-ComicInfo) +
  all-English series names → **0 foreign**. 787 cbr (RAR) unreadable for ComicInfo but all US-comic
  series names — no language concern.

## R2.3 — Results (per kind)
| Kind | Scanned | Foreign found | Quarantined | Re-grabs queued | Ambiguous → owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EBooks (Kavita) | 1374 epub (+92 azw3/62 mobi) | 33 | 33 | 0 (see Q-04) | 1 (La Chute folder-name) |
| AudioBooks (ABS) | 826 books / 24.6k audio | 25 | 25 | 0 (see Q-04) | 3 (Truckers/Snuff/Fantastic Mr Fox) + Mosley cluster |
| Comics (Kavita) | 51 series / 1733 files | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| F-09 corrupt epubs | 3 | (already quarantined) | — | **3 (Wanted, EN)** | 0 |
- EBooks foreign by language: **18 Dutch, 7 German, 7 Danish, 1 French**.
- AudioBooks foreign: **23 German audiobooks + 2 misfiled foreign epubs** (Chain of Iron = German epub;
  Destructora de espadas = Spanish epub — both were sitting inside the ABS tree).

## R2.4 — Quarantine manifest (all under `books/quarantine/f10-language/`, MOVE + rescan, reversible)

  "reads fine" = renders, NOT English); Julia Quinn/"Buscando esposa (Spanish Edition)…" (**OPF title

  Victoria Aveyard/"Destructora de espadas…" (Spanish epub).
- Empty author folders left after moves (harmless, not deleted): EBooks/Isaac Asimov,
  AudioBooks/Alice Oseman, AudioBooks/Tomi Adeyemi.

## R2.5 — LL re-grabs queued + governor/LL state observed
- **F-09 corrupt (explicit mandate) — 3 English re-grabs queued** via GB-volume-id → `addBook` →
  `queueBook` → `searchBook` (503 backoff fired twice, recovered): **Skyward** (Brandon Sanderson, GB
  `RPq0DwAAQBAJ`), **Sweet and Deadly** (Charlaine Harris, `vcpmEQAAQBAJ`), **Skin in the Game** (Taleb,
  `xTFMtAEACAAJ`). All three now **Status=Wanted, BookLang=en** in LL (verified in
  `/config/lazylibrarian.db`). NOTE: `addBook` alone lands books as **`Skipped`** — must follow with
  `queueBook` to reach `Wanted` (searchBook won't act on Skipped). Corrupt+original backups remain in
  `books/quarantine/f09-corrupt/` and `…/f09-originals/` (untouched).
- **Existing LL retry queue UNTOUCHED:** `getWanted` = Throne of Glass + Kingdom of Ash (as briefed).
- **Governor / MAM:** qBittorrent `books-mam` = **19 torrents, all 19 unsatisfied** (<72h / maturing
  ~Tue eve) → over the pause threshold (15) → **gate CLOSED (correct)**. Usenet unaffected. Did not
  touch the Prowlarr MAM indexer or governor CronJob.

## R2.6 — Adjacent sweeps
- **azw3/mobi-only titles (invisible to Kavita): 146** (Kavita only indexes epub). Conversion
  candidates, but **LL image has no calibre — NOT converted** (per constraint), listed only. Notable
  **foreign** stray among them: `EBooks/Dennis E. Taylor/Potomu chto nas mnogo` = **Russian** ("We Are
  Legion" translation) `.mobi`. Big clusters: Tom Clancy (~24 mobi guided-tours), Kim Stanley Robinson
  (~11), James S.A. Corey Expanse origins/novellas (~9), Douglas Adams, Roald Dahl, Veronica Roth.
- **Empty / no-book EBooks title folders: 60** — includes the expected-empty F-09 shells (Skyward,
  "Sweet and Deadly by Harris…", Skin in the Game — epubs live in `f09-corrupt/`), plus foreign-titled
  empties (Charlaine Harris/{Allemaal dood, Echt dood}, John Grisham/{De onschuldigen, Domarens Brev},
  Ken Follett/Der Mann aus St. Petersburg). All harmless (no content). +1 ABS phantom:
  `AudioBooks/J.R.R. Tolkien/Der Herr der Ringe - Die zwei Türme` = metadata.json+cover only, **no
  audio** (German-titled empty ABS entry — reported, not moved).
- **Mixed-format title dirs: 4** — Roald Dahl/Matilda (azw3+epub+mobi), Sarah J. Maas/{Crown of
  Midnight, The Assassin and the Underworld, Tower of Dawn} = the session-5 English re-grabs landed
  beside old azw3/mobi. Old-format duplicates; Kavita prefers the epub. Low-priority cleanup.
- **F-09 leftovers:** 3 corrupt = re-grab-queued (above). The **7 other-defect epubs** (5× "Unsupported
  EPUB v1.0" package attrs + 2× EPUB3-nav) remain **untouched/in-library** (readable; distinct defect
  class; calibre-less image = no in-place fix) — carried forward as their own polish item.

## R2.7 — Owner questions / decisions (Q-04…Q-07)
- **Q-04 (the big one — English re-grab batch, owner GO):** the 58 quarantined foreign items leave real
  gaps (the ONLY Foundation/Eragon-ebook/Dune-ebook, and the Queen of Air and Darkness / Murtagh /
  Outlander-bk4 audio, etc. are now absent). Per the brief's SCOPE only the **3 F-09 corrupt** were an
  explicit queue mandate; re-grabbing **58** more is a **major acquisition wave** (governor gate closed,
  ratio economy, "audit not crawl-storm") → **held for an owner GO** rather than auto-queued. The full
  per-title candidate list is R2.4. On GO, run them usenet-first via LL (GB-volume-id → addBook →
  queueBook → searchBook, 503 backoff) — small paced batches.
- **Q-05 (ambiguous audio, left untouched):** `Terry Pratchett/Truckers` and `Terry Pratchett/Snuff`
  carry a **Dutch genre tag `Luisterboek`** but English album/track titles and (Truckers) `COMM=eng` —
  evidence leans English; not quarantined. `Roald Dahl/Fantastic Mr Fox` = `luisterboek` genre but
  **TPUB "BBC Worldwide" + English titles → English** (spurious genre). Confirm on the player?
- **Q-06 (Walter Mosley "Hoerbuch" cluster — FYI, NOT foreign):** ~25 Walter Mosley audiobooks carry
  genre `Hoerbuch` but **every substantive tag (album/title/artist) is English** — a German genre label
  on English audio (same false-positive class as the bad epub tags). Left untouched. Several have
  `n=1` single-file oddities (possible completeness issue, not language) — flagged for a later check.
- **Q-07 (naming oddity, left untouched):** `EBooks/James S.A. Corey/La Chute du Léviathan - The Expanse
  9` has a **French folder name but the epub is ENGLISH** (OPF title "Leviathan Wakes", US-copyright
  text). Rename the folder; content is fine.
- Carry-over: the **calibre gap** in LL's image (azw3/mobi→epub) would rescue the 146 azw3/mobi-only
  strays without re-grabs — a sidecar/image-swap is the durable fix (design input for the Books Saga).

## R2.8 — What was done (all constraints honored)
Quarantine = MOVE only (`books/quarantine/f10-language/…`), never delete; Kavita+ABS rescanned after.
Only the 3 explicit F-09 re-grabs queued (via LL, usenet-first). **No MAM grabs, no qBittorrent adds,
no Prowlarr indexer/governor toggles, no disturbance to LL's ToG/Kingdom-of-Ash queue, no deletions.**
Ambiguous items left for the owner. No app code / haynes-ops / other plans / HANDOFF touched. No release.
